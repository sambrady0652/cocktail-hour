Drain and discard the soaking liquid.

Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours. When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion.\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôre having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher.
